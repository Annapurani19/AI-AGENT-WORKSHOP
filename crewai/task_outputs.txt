Task 3:
Description: 
Create a feature and task plan based on user journey and project context: {"project": "Task Management App", "goal": "Streamline task assignment and tracking", "audience": ["Developers", "Managers"], "feedback": "Users want intuitive UI, real-time updates, and easy task prioritization"}.
Generate a JSON structure with application, user_roles, objectives, feedback, and target_outcomes. Ensure the plan includes:
1. Intuitive UI: Drag-and-drop functionality, clear visual cues, tooltips.
2. Real-time Updates: Status indicators, live comment feeds, notification badges.
3. Easy Task Prioritization: Drag-and-drop prioritization, customizable filters, visual priority indicators (e.g., color-coding, icons).
Output a valid JSON string without any additional text or markers.

Task 5:
Description: 
Refine the feature plan and action map based on feedback: Mentor Feedback: Prioritize real-time notifications over complex UI animations.
User Feedback: Need simple task creation and status tracking..
Use the following JSON as the base and enhance the 'ui_elements' in the 'journey' sections for both Manager and Developer roles to address:
1. Intuitive UI: Add drag-and-drop functionality, clear visual cues, and tooltips.
2. Real-time Updates: Include status indicators, live comment feeds, and notification badges.
3. Easy Task Prioritization: Add drag-and-drop prioritization, customizable filters, and visual priority indicators (e.g., color-coding, icons).
Ensure the refined JSON maintains the structure: application, user_roles, objectives, feedback, target_outcomes, and includes a change_log with entries like "Added drag-and-drop for task prioritization".
Output ONLY a valid JSON string with no additional text, explanations, or markers (e.g., no ```json ```, no "Here is the output:"). Example:
{
  "application": "Task Assignment and Tracking",
  "user_roles": [...],
  "objectives": "...",
